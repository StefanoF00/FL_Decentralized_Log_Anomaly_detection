# Control Engineering Master' Thesis: "Anomaly Detection in Mobile Edge Computing Infrastructures using Application Logs: an Adaptive Federated Learning and Finite Time Consensus-based Approach"

As part of the [__NANCY__](https://nancy-project.eu) project funded by European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, this work proposes two federated approaches for performing anomaly detection on log files produced by a Mobile Edge Computing infrastructure. The proposed algorithms preserve the privacy of the various clients participating in the infrastructure. 

## AdaLightLog Algorithm
This first framework, based on FL algorithm __AdaFed__, relies on a central server for the parameter averaging procedure. This proposed algorithm was presented in the proceedings of the International Conference on Critical Information Infrastructures Security [CRITIS2024](https://critis2024.uniroma3.it) - submitted on 31/05/2024 and discussed on 18/09/2024 - and was a finalist for the Young CRITIS Award. 

## DecAdaLightLog Algorithm
It is a framework that, based on finite-time consensus protocol for multi-agent systems and Physics-Informed Neural Networks, has a totally distributed nature. It doesnt depend on a central coordinating server that represents a point of failure for cyber-physical attacks. Given the innovative contribution and the surprising results of this algorithm, it is planned to submit the complete work for further publication in a scientific journal.
